This document aims to make a plan for the code to work with this document

The header files shall be divided based on functions. 
1 movement - movement.cpp
2 sensing - 
3 tasks which build on the previous headers
4 

the sensors and motors will be calibrated in the main function. 
The main function will basically call the tasks

Each function will be very short: should fit one page
